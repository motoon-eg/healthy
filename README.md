## DI Container ðŸ’‰
**DI container** is like a central hub that stores and manages the dependencies.

We are using [**Factory Package**](https://github.com/hmlongco/Factory) as a Dependency Injection Cantainer.

### How to use it:
Here's a simple dependency registration that returns a service that conforms to `MyServiceType`.

```swift
extension Container {
    var myService: Factory<MyServiceType> { 
        Factory(self) { MyService() }
    }
}
```

Injecting an instance of our service is straightforward, you can do it in two ways:

**1**

```swift
class ContentViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Injected(\.myService) private var myService
    ...
}
```
**2**
```swift
class ContentViewModel: ObservableObject {
    private let myService = Container.shared.myService()
    ...
}
```

# By default, SwiftLint uses a set of sensible default rules you can adjust:
disabled_rules: # rule identifiers turned on by default to exclude from running  
  # TODOs and FIXMEs should be resolved.
  - todo
  
  # swiftlint:disable commands should be re-enabled before the end of the file
  # Needed for auto generated files from templates
  - blanket_disable_command
  
# some rules are turned off by default, so you need to opt-in
opt_in_rules:
  # Prefer checking isEmpty over comparing count to zero
  - empty_count
  
  # Force casts should be avoided
  - force_cast
  
  # Force unwrapping should be avoided
  - force_unwrapping
  
  # Header comments should be consistent with project patterns.
  - file_header
  
  # MARK comment should be in valid format. e.g. ‘// MARK: …’ or ‘// MARK: - …’
  - mark
  
  # Function parameters should be aligned vertically if they’re in multiple lines in a method call
  - vertical_parameter_alignment_on_call
